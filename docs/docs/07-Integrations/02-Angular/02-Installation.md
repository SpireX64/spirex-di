# Installation

The **SpireX/DI** ↔ **Angular** bridge can be easily installed using your preferred package manager:

```shell
# NPM
npm install @spirex/di @spirex/di-angular-bridge

# Yarn
yarn add @spirex/di @spirex/di-angular-bridge
```

> Note: The bridge is designed specifically for **Angular** applications
> and requires the core **SpireX/DI** package (@spirex/di) to be installed.

## Environment Requirements
- **SpireX/DI ^1.1.0** — The bridge relies on the *Middleware API* introduced in this version.
- The bridge fully supports **Angular 14 or higher**.
